# RandomProjects
Repository for smaller projects that I have or am working on.
<h1>Repository Structure</h1>
<p>Each folder is a different project, and is maintained seperately. Projects are all completed independently.</p>
<h2>Why does this Exist?</h2>
<p> I have recently learned that just because you know something does not mean anything if you have not shown yourself applying it.
<p>All projects are an attempt at 
putting my knowledge of languages and framworks into visible focus.</p>
